# Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest
In this analysis, I worked with the Iris dataset, deploying multiple algorithms to assess their performance. I split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to ensure robust evaluation. To optimize model performance, I utilized GridSearchCV to identify the best hyperparameters. This selection process is crucial as it helps prevent overfitting and underfitting, striking a balance between model complexity and generalization.

I explored the RIPPER algorithm, which is rule-based and designed for handling noisy and imbalanced data. Given that the Iris dataset is balanced, the performance of RIPPER was comparable to that of decision trees. While RIPPER extracts rules based on the relationships between features and class labels, decision trees utilize partition-based methods for classification.

Additionally, I examined Random Forests, which offer a more robust solution by combining the predictions of multiple trees. This ensemble approach reduces sensitivity to outliers and noise, though it can be more challenging to interpret compared to decision trees.

Ultimately, I observed that the best performance was achieved with the RIPPER algorithm and the C4.5 decision tree. However, Random Forests consistently outperformed individual decision trees due to their ensemble nature, effectively reducing overfitting by aggregating the predictions of multiple models.
